 <h1>Dead!</h1>

 <h2></h2>

    <p>I died around 3 days ago and it's become a humungous pain in the ass to deal with ever since. My body still aches everywhere but at least I don't have to worry about the extra pain from lying down in that hospital bed anymore. As I pace around in the waiting room, not knowing if I’d be able to pass away normally, I looked for a wall to punch or a table to bang my head against guess I don’t even have that luxury anymore. As I face the psychics and co. sign I begin to think about all the work I'd have to do to pay for all these fees. Why am I still here exactly? Is it my missing rent or-</p>
<p>“WHAT? Oh ok, I see. Thank you, sweetie I’ll let him know right away,” she sighed as her smile dissolved and she tidied up her stack of paper. “Welp, congratulations boy, they found your left arm and finished grafting your bones together” she said, rather casually “you’re a very lucky one, the body ended up flying to the side of the train on impact and landed in a tree. Minimal damage to the face, so your dating life shouldn't suffer much at all!”</p>
<p>Her face made this strange expression where she widened her eyes and stretched her grin to the sides of her face, making me furious. I was still trying to process what happened since my death, so I retaliated, “How are you so nonchalant about this? Who cares if my face is still here or not, how much is this gonna cost?”</p>
<p>The old lady cackled for a good minute as if I told the best joke ever heard, it's probably the happiest I’ve seen her since the first time I was standing here at this office. “Ok listen honey you’ll need to pay for the investigation into your reason for being here, assistants to interact with the mortal plane, a service fee to cover your body’s preservation, and-”</p>
<p>“Screw the preservation fee! I'm not planning to stay in this living hell for long,&quot; I said as my brows sunk into the middle of my face</p>
<p>“Think of this as a second chance, your parents still don't know you're a ghost, right? I'm sure they’ll be relieved to spend more time with you” she replied in a way that wanted to get a reaction out of me, yet I didn't let happen. I ended up paying for everything except the preservation fee, which I told the lady I'd “consider.”</p>
<p>As I float back to my apartment, I keep thinking about how mad my parents would be if they’d find out I turned ghost, hell how mad they’d be if they found out I were dead. Usually, this type of thing only happens to billionaires or criminals who’ve done heinous activities and had loose ends to tie up. Lucky for them, they have enough funds to cover for everything and more; I am not one of them. The assistant I did receive was basically a roommate who had to do chores for me, and I shared an income with. He had bleached hair, a neon green domo shirt, ripped jeans 2 sizes too big for him, and a backwards flat cap with the word “swag” on it. When we finally made it to my place, he stared around in awe, so I assume this was his last option for work judging by his reaction to the goblin cave I called home. I sat down on the couch (or rather pretended to) and watched some tv to distract myself. It was the first day so naturally things would be very awkward between the both of us (that and the fact that I needed some much-needed rest). He seems quiet so maybe this wasn't such a bad situation after al-</p>
<p>“So like, no sex?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“You can't touch anything right?”</p>
<p>“No”</p>
<p>“No booze?”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>He paused for a second to prepare for what I thought was an apology, until he spilled out, “that's hella wack man, I had a ghost friend once, it's like... really brutal what you guys go through for real. I just can't imagine it happening to me, I think I’d literally kill myself ha-ha. Anyways I'm Rowan”</p>
<p>After having that conversation, I started considering doing it again myself. Still, this is all I can afford now, so might as well make the best of it. I swiveled in front of him then asked, “So uh, what's your story? How’d you figure out you can see ghosts?”</p>
<p>“Well, my mama used to tell me how she was the only one in the farmhouse who could see my granny’s spirit. When I turned 10, I could finally see her as well!”</p>
<p>“Sounds cool”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but she kept denying it and telling me I was lying, she was a crazy evil woman; very cruel. ‘ventually I got old enough to go to community college and live on my own”</p>
<p>The sudden revelation of that information startled me, so I questioned further, &quot;You went to college?”</p>
<p>“I figured out there were others like me there! They took me in and helped me realize my full potential. I was struggling in school so the whole place kept telling me to get this job; which I did” He had this expression where it looked as if he really believed this was all normal.</p>
<p>I ended up asking more about his life and the more I found out about his past, the more I questioned whether he was making it up. Regardless of what he’s been through I still needed help keeping my apartment clean, so he got to work right away without much issue. The whole place was dusted, vacuumed and the dishes were done over the next few hours. Sure, we got along well for the most part but every so often He’d say something so impossibly stupid, I questioned how I didn't end up becoming his assistant first. Eventually I got a call from work as I was lecturing Rowan on how it was impossible for his uncle to fit an entire melon in his ear.</p>
<p>My iphone rang on the countertop for a few seconds before Rowan picked it up and I heard my boss’ grating voice, “I’ve received news that you died and are still here, that's unfortunate. Work still begins tomorrow at 10pm same as usua-”</p>
<p>“WAIT. I can't work the keyboard by myself I need my assistant there with me” I’ve been cutoff by him too many times beforehand, maybe dying gave me the extra confidence I needed to stop my boss. Either way I was sweating bullets now because the long pause afterwards had me worried.</p>
<p>“One moment then,” she said as the grainy hold music began to play</p>
<p>“Awesome! I get to do your job for you now that you’re dead,” Rowan interjected</p>
<p>“You need to think 3 times before you speak”</p>
<p>“But I did think 3 times”</p>
<p>“Then think 4,” I responded harshly. I put my head in my hands and rub my eyes anxiously, “ok I need you to realize I work in serious big business. This isn't just any job, it's my job. You have to be 100% there with me all the way. Don't even worry about training because I'll tell you everything you need to know.”</p>
<p>I watched Rowan cross his heart and place his hand on his chest before responding, “I solemnly swear to do my best in helping you and in following your instructions”</p>
<p>The phone clicked again, and I heard my boss yell out again, “Congratulations Lucas your seat is open for your assistant to start trading. I expect him to honor the same etiquette and dress code as you have before.”</p>
<p>“Thats great! I promise I won't let you down, it's only been about a day of meeting him, but I think my assistant and I will do a great job.” Rowan hung up suddenly and I wore a look of concern. My phone fell out of his hands and the screen shattered everywhere on the floor</p>
<p>“What the hell man!? What's the matter with you?”</p>
<p>He grabbed the counter and began to tremble as if he’d seen a ghost. He stayed like this for a good few second then calmed down and told me, “Lucas I'm not good at math or computers. I...I don't think I can do this. The whole reason I wanted this job was cause there wouldn't be any numbahs.”</p>
<p>I sighed in frustration like a parent would after scolding their child and said, “doesn't matter if you are. I’ll be there to help you out. It's my job, not yours remember? You swore you’d help me”</p>
<p>“I didn't think it’d be this type of thing!” he told me with crazy eyes</p>
<p>“I believe in you. Just go to sleep on the couch, I’ll head to my room, and we’ll get ready to wake up 6am tomorrow” I replied as he began to leave. I floated down to the floor and whispered, “Hey Siri. Set an alarm for 6 am tomorrow”</p>
<p>“You think I can really do it?” I heard him say as I set 5 mores alarms for the following day</p>
<p>“Yeah. For sure”</p>
<p>“Thank you man,”</p>
<p>I did not at all.</p>
<p>The following morning went better than expected, Rowan woke up after the 4th alarm and I didn't need to shower or change my clothes because there was no need to. Breakfast was the most depressing part of this for me because I wasn't even allowed the pleasure of smelling the pancakes Rowan gobbled up. A few minutes after that it was time to get ready to get dressed and leave.</p>
<p>“No, you gotta put the vest on first then wear the tie” I said while watching him struggle “Hey. HEY! Here let me show you”</p>
<p>Whoosh. Both my hands jabbed through the suit as a cold reminder to myself.</p>
<p>“I’ll just look up a tutorial then” he said trying to take the attention away from what happened.</p>
<p>“When you’re done go look for the subway tickets I left in the drawer, I buy them in bulk every month so there should be a fair amount still in there”</p>
<p>I flew through the doorframe and stared at the wallpaper in the hallway. My head was full of moments like these, but this one has been the most frustrating by far, and it got me thinking: My reflection this morning wasn't looking so good. Cloudy eyes, thinning hair and my skin looked dry. There hasn't been a call from the psychic's office yet, so that means I still don't know what my unfinished business is. My legs still hurt from the train accident, and I can't touch anything ever again, so why keep me around? When will it end? When will it end?</p>
<p>My thoughts were interrupted as I saw Rowan strut out the door in my suit and do a little dance. He looked at me as if he’d won the lottery and yelled out, “YEAH! Check it out! I'm a whole businessman now!”</p>
<p>My face stayed in the same confused expression for a few minutes until he broke the silence by pulling out a subway ticket, fwip “uh, you told me there’d be a ton in your drawer, but I just found this one”</p>
<p>His response caught me off guard, so I made up a lie, “I was uh... planning to travel before I got hit by the train obviously. Didn't buy any for the month I’d be gone”</p>
<p>“Is that why you also had that wad of cash in that envelope?” he asked as my pupils dilated</p>
<p>“Were you snooping? I swear to God if you were snooping”</p>
<p>Rowan backed up frowning, then explained, “I swear I wasn't! The envelope was just sitting on top of a letter to your family I didn't read it honestly!”</p>
<p>“What letter? Where?</p>
<p>“It was on the kitchen table man”</p>
<p>“Oh. Sorry, that was a... love letter... to my boss” I responded in a serious tone</p>
<p>Rowan laughed a bit upon hearing that then cleared his throat to be respectful, “wait but why the cash?”</p>
<p>“You ask too many questions; c'mon you’ll be late for the subway,” I said while gesturing towards the elevator.</p>
<p>I said my farewell and hurriedly jumped out the window to leave for work, watching the few others like me do the same thing. Despite all that's gone wrong, this was one of the best things about being incorporeal. I didn't feel the wind in my face, but I got to witness the beauty of the city lights in the early morning for the first time. I took the scenic route heading to work, admiring the sparkling lights and the sounds of the city atop the exclusive heights. As I lay on my back and stare at the many stars above, it reminds me of something my brother used to say. “I bet every star up there belongs to someone who kicked the bucket. I'll make sure to get a real bougie one if that's true.” He was a funny kid.</p>
<p>Of course, he lived a good life without trouble and died normally, he never turned ghost. So why is it that I'm still here mourning his loss, looking up trying to find his star?</p>
<p>“Lucas?” I heard a familiar voice call my name</p>
<p>“What the hell?” I responded as I looked around, opening my eyes. I floated right onto my floor and bumped into Rowan by complete accident. “Oh, it's you. Wait, how did you beat me to work? You took the subway here.”</p>
<p>“Thats the thing, I couldn't take the subway because I had no idea what I was doing. walked all the way over here instead. It was way easier”</p>
<p>I fully opened my eyes and raised my brow in disbelief, “You fucking what?”</p>
<p>“You’re not one to talk, boss told me I was late, so imagine how late you are compared to me,” he rebutted</p>
<p>“You haven't been doing any work for the past-” I checked the clock and winced “2 hours?”</p>
<p>“I talked to jeff; he seemed like a lot of work to me. Dudes got a narcissism problem.”</p>
<p>“Well, jeff is the supervisor so- Augh! That's beside the point. Let's just hurry up,” I said while shaking my head and heading towards my cubicle in the corner.</p>
<p>Rowan sat down and turned on the computer, following my instructions to the best of his ability. “Click on that now” “drag this here” “ok now make a spreadsheet.” We were making good progress until I heard the sound of pretentious high heels laughing our way.</p>
<p>“You’re late coward. Best get moving on this if you wanna stay here,” she said slamming a stack of papers on my desk before walking away.</p>
<p>I tilted my head down in anger and glared at her back as she walked away. You wouldn't be saying that if you were in my shoes, would you? What do you know about struggle? You’re nothing but an old money out of touch old lady.</p>
<p>“Is this because you never asked her out?” whispered Rowan as he grabbed a paper off the stack.</p>
<p>“NO!” I jabbed out suddenly, catching the attention of the few coworkers who could see me. “My boss is the worst she was just referring to my death,” I explained angerly</p>
<p>“Why would getting hit by a train be cowardly?”</p>
<p>“Hey, let's not speak that way of the mentally ill, shall we?” said my coworker unaware I was present</p>
<p>“You shut your mouth Jacob before I shut it for you,” I replied in vain</p>
<p>I continued to do my work, getting increasingly frustrated with each page we finished together. “Print them out” “ok now type in 777-698-43...” “ “like, like, dislike, like” “ok now block her”</p>
<p>“Were you running away from a fight?”</p>
<p>I froze in place for a second before deciding to respond, “You just don't get it do you Rowan? I chose to get hit by that train” He looked shocked and betrayed, making me question if I made the right choice by telling him. “I just had a lot on my mind was all. Was kinda hoping I’d be reunited with my brother when I jumped onto those tracks. So... I did everything possible to make sure I wouldn't be a ghost before leaving.”</p>
<p>“Is that what the letter was for?”</p>
<p>“yeah”</p>
<p>“What about the wad of money?”</p>
<p>“A parting gift to my parents. I always told them I’d make it and help them out, but that ambition was never really enough.”</p>
<p>“...Did it hurt?”</p>
<p>“Not as much as losing Lorenzo no”</p>
<p>The office lights were blinding, and the air an uncomfortable moist heat. The next few hours were the most awkward of my life. No small talk or further questions, just me trying not to break down while telling Rowan what to do, and him following instructions, while asking the occasional question. This continued for a while until he suddenly stopped and talked to me again.</p>
<p>“let's leave”</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what convinced me, but I went with him down the elevator. I looked around inside the thing and heard the speaker shout, “Would Rowan Brown and Lucas Vivar please head to Mrs. Jhonson’s office?”</p>
<p>“This feels so uncanny,” I said chuckling to myself.</p>
<p>“How come?”</p>
<p>“It's the exact same situation I was in 5 years ago with my brother. The principle got mad at us because the pigeon we used for a magic act went #2 on a girl’s head.”</p>
<p>“Did it really? Who did it hit”</p>
<p>“The VP’s daughter,” I said as the elevator door opened.</p>
<p>We left the building, and I felt a huge weight come off my shoulders. Rowan then asked me, “so what do you wanna do now?”</p>
<p>That was a question I never really asked myself before.</p>
