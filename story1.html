 <h1>Attack of the crocodile chick</h1>

 <h2></h2>

    <h1>Encounter</h1>
<p>The encounter happened 2 days after I escaped from the riot I caused; it was a spur of the moment decision which ended up teleporting me into the fortress in the sky. The place is a million-ton marvel of technology from the past, an entire mass of land levitating miles off the ground, right above my town. I came here with a few goals in mind, find father at the top of the island, retrieve my Solid-State-Drive, and become whole again. The decay and darkness were frightening at first but all I really needed to do was keep my battery charged and head steady to see this through. From what I've been told in school, the island used to be a sanctuary turned military fortress after the bombs dropped. Obviously, it didn't work since it's full of corpses now, but the technology that fell from the island attracted a lot of people, making my town a bustling community of engineers. During my first day on the island I mainly focused on gathering anything useful I could find and trying to reach an information center so I could navigate the place better. The space I landed in was like one of the large shopping centers back in the center of town (only on a larger scale), so it took a while for me to find a map. Since the teleporter was against my favor, it landed me on the seventh level of the island, and I had a long way to go before reaching the top. I was a mile away from the nearest staircase, sixty-three flights of stairs, and a few dozen mercs away from my goal. After that I came to accept that I'd be there a while, so I decided to dedicate the rest of that day to building a camp.</p>
<p>On the 2nd day, that's when it happened. I was in a storage room gathering supplies when I heard a noise. It was pitch black and this noise was unlike anything I’ve ever heard before. It was beastly and disturbing, so I hid inside one of the lockers and planned to wait it out. It walked away but I still sensed the creature’s presence nearby, this thing wouldn't leave. 5 minutes later, the lights came back on.</p>
<p>Was this a person? Some service bot? Why now, of all times, to fix the lights?</p>
<p>I didn't have time to think as its cries of agony neared my location. I shivered within the locker, not from the cold but dread of what exactly made those terrible cries. Its shadow was cast upon the hallway, revealing the silhouette of its fur and hideous ears. It was hard to make out any more details through the slits, but I couldn’t risk making any noise trying to get a closer look. When it entered the room, I heard its horrible moaning as it dragged itself along the floor. The creature opened each locker one by one, scavenging, scratching, shaking, desperate to find anything to eat. I couldn't bear to see the thing’s face, but it was already too late. I could feel its breath as my door opened. In that moment I thought to myself, “If I die, at least look the enemy in the face,” but even in this labyrinth of darkness, the trials and hardships I faced couldn’t have prepared me for what I was about to witness.</p>
<p>It's a chick?</p>
<p>I jumped out of the locker and started rolling on the floor laughing from disbelief. I was bewildered and out of breath but also trying not to cry from the fear I felt earlier. When I looked her in the face, she was salivating and had a wild look in her eyes, wearing a standard mail uniform (dirty and smelly but still intact). Everything seemed to be normal except the language on that cap… I couldn't recognize it. Come to think of it, the carriers here never used that emblem either.  I always suspected that we were being told lies about being the last population of humanity, but I never expected the evidence to just show up in front of me.</p>
<p>I was so excited I could barely contain my questioning any longer, “There's more people?” No response. “Are there other people out there? Tell me there's a world out there!”</p>
<p>She responded by lunging towards my shoulder and biting down. I let out a painful yell as her teeth sank into my clavicle. This was the second worst thing to happen to me this week, fortunately it takes a lot to kill me since I'm not actually human. Unfortunately, I needed to feed this monster before it starved, seeing as I can't violate the first law of robotics. Lethal force wasn't an option, so a quick knee to the gut and a left hook was enough to incapacitate her safely. The walk back to camp went without issue, and I dropped her near my stack of tuna cans. Feeling exhausted and annoyed, I opened a can as she awoke and tossed it on her face (a good morning to my attacker). The tuna was devoured within seconds and seemed to be enough to help regain her humanity. Despair and regret washed over her face, and her lips began to move so I listened in anticipation of what would be said.</p>
<p>“Ego cucurrit ex hebdomada ante cibum .... MISER Ignosce mihi. sic mihi ignosces?”</p>
<p>I had no clue what any of that meant but I didn't care. My dad was still up there, and I had to keep moving; STILL, at the same time it would be wrong to leave someone alone in a place like this. Not knowing what to do, I asked for a name to see if I could find some common ground.</p>
<p>“veni iterum? Quid dicis”</p>
<p>I pointed to myself and said my name, “Milo.”</p>
<p>“lucille... aut lucy”</p>
<p>There's no way I’d ever get used to this. So, I decided to sit and think of what to do, all while she tried to apologize and bandage up my bite. The situation became too real, and I started having major doubts.</p>
<p>Even If I found my dad what would I do? Be sent back down, that's for sure. No way in hell he’ll give up his job. I left behind my family, friends, and the second chance I had to make things right. People like me shouldn't take up such valuable space and resources. Who did I think I was coming up here? I really should’ve just turned myself in to guarantee their safety.</p>
<p>And so, I laid there on the bare concrete, contemplating if giving up was really the right choice.</p>
<p>“cur humi struis? Non est locus cedere!”</p>
<p>“We’re gonna die up here. There's only so much time left until we run out of food now that I got you tagging along. I suggest you leave me here and take my stuff, I won't be needing it if I'm dead.”</p>
<p>“surgite! Im 'non relinquens te”</p>
<p>I didn’t see any way this could work, so I snapped at her, “Spanish motherfucker, do you speak it!?” I buried my face in my hands and tried to regain my composure, issuing an apology, “Look I know I'm the only person you’ve seen in a while but If we’re sticking together, we need to find a way to communicate that isn't vocal.”</p>
<p>As I glanced back up, I noticed it took only a few seconds for her face to cake with tears, and I immediately regretted my outburst.</p>
<p>“Inimici sumus? Quaeso ne dicas nos sumus... me diu hic assequi, im in missione, auxilium placet…”</p>
<p>I didn't really know how to respond to that, so I figured that starting over would be a wise decision. I held my hand up and pulled off my V-neck, pointing towards the gaping hole in my chest.</p>
<p>“Listen, I'm here to retrieve something important so sorry if I'm being rude but I don't have much time.”</p>
<p>The exposed machinery and titanium bone were enough of a shock to distract her from my outburst. She seemed to understand and took off her hat and gloves, revealing a pair of ears on top her head, and hairy hands with claws. I'm not even sure if there's a word to describe exactly what she was, but I felt a strange kinship in that moment, taking comfort in the fact that I’d been out freaked. My feelings were interrupted by the alarm of my internal clock, which beeped 10:00 pm, so I drew the time on the floor.</p>
<p>“Decem noctibus.”</p>
<p>“Are numbers universal to people?” No response.</p>
<p>There was so much for me to ask but nothing I could do about it.</p>
<p>If I had access to one of the terminals here maybe I could download a dictionary of the language she uses? No, I could do much more than that; that's tomorrow's plan.</p>
<p>A bit afterwards the fire started burning the last of our fuel, so I gestured towards the mail room, and she ran off to fetch more paper and cardboard. When she came back there was a package in her hands that was branded with a flag I’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>She responded by patting the package and smiling, “suus 'aliquid ipsum.”</p>
<p>“Give it here.”</p>
<p>When I looked at the recipient's name, I saw… my father? I realized we had the same goal, which was going to make things a lot simpler.</p>
<p>I felt overjoyed and motioned to the name hysterically, “Moreno? Thats my dad! Did you come to deliver something?”</p>
<p>“Quid clamas? esne recipiens?”</p>
<p>“All this way just to deliver it? Give it here!”</p>
<p>She ripped my arms off the box with surprising strength and cursed me out (or I think she did). I figured it was too much trouble to try and explain myself, so I settled for planning a peep inside the box once she fell asleep. We made do with what we had, just talking to each other and drawing on the dirt floor, even though we couldn't speak each other’s language. Come to think of it, I haven’t had this much fun since I was a kid. After I started slipping up in secondary school, I got less and less free time, and much more work to do. I wasn't sure if her town worked the same as mine, but being a bad student here is a death sentence, it's a large source of where you earn money. If you don't prove yourself to be a worthy asset to the cause, you don't get sponsored and end up having to pay for everything yourself. The place needed geniuses to further its development, and guess who wasn’t a genius? Time went by fast, and it was 12 before I knew it. We would freeze if the winds outside kept blowing in, so I grabbed my sleeping bag and gave her my tent’s fabric to use as a blanket.</p>
<p>“You got any ideas?” I questioned rubbing my arms.</p>
<p>She pointed down a stairwell and responded, “Cur ferventi non uteris cella?”</p>
<p>I looked in the direction of her finger and saw it was a boiler room, which surprisingly was still in good condition. It was an exhausting day, so we dropped onto the floor just as the warm air hit our faces. Sure, we were comfortable in the moment, but I still didn't know what the right call for tomorrow was. I sat there worried, wondering if there was enough food to make it to the top with 2 people now. My internal monologue was cut short as I felt a can hit the back of my head with a loud THOCK.</p>
<p>“Haha! paenitet, non vult ad ledo caput tuum”</p>
<p>I glared back angrily but began to laugh as well, confused as to why I had lightened up. The pain was a reminder of why I needed the drive in the first place, so I decided to explain myself now that we’d calmed down.</p>
<p>“I know you won't understand me but try and hear me out. The thing I'm looking for is my drive, right here” I said motioning to the hole again. “If I get it back, I’ll be way stronger and smarter than I am right now, that’ll help me do better in school and work harder, thus reversing the damage I’ve done and make everyone think im a hero!”</p>
<p>There was a long awkward pause, finally answered with a, “eh?”</p>
<p>This is the perfect opportunity to vent out my problems</p>
<p>“He’s the reason why I’ve been having such hard times, if he hadn't taken that drive out of my chest, I would have been smarter, faster, stronger and a whole load of other things.” Her face was confused, but I continued speaking feeling even more inspired to do so “My whole existence is absurd, why’d he create a machine whose as smart as the average person; what need is there for me to feel pain? Hunger? He’s a monster and for that, he’s gotta pay”</p>
<p>When it turned late, I stayed up trying to think of a way to better our situation for tomorrow. Lucy was knocked out, snoring open mouthed at full volume. I took notice of her teeth and realized she had fangs; it wasn't just my imagination.</p>
<p>If she's a demon sent here to kill me, I’d be perfectly fine with that. Its either I win and face the wrath of my father or lose and get imprisoned for starting a riot and using up that teleporter’s energy.</p>
<p>For someone who was dressed like a homeless person, she was rocking the look. The language barrier was a turn off, but she seemed like a kind person, cause no one else has made me laugh this much. It's hilarious how low of a bar it was for me to get attached, I was attacked and befriended by the same person in one day. I never gave love much attention, well I guess whatever the type of emotion I was feeling was. Sure, I had my family but they’re more like a responsibility to me, same with my brother Spencers (what a bum). I wondered if it was instincts or a genuine bond I was feeling.</p>
<p>What if we do survive this? Then what will she think of my house? A Metal roof? Curtains for doors? A fucking bucket for showering? There's no way I can let her hang at my place. I can't really bring anything to the table besides fish from my job.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome of this was, I knew for sure that I’d found a real friend that day.</p>
